## What I Did:
#
# 1. Moodernized a bit the old website with a dark theme.
# 2. Followed the same structure of the previous site with a bit of change.
# 3. Created a Wordpress template from the old site. Made a wp-menu.
# 4. Created Wordpress pages following the notes.
# 5. Created a blog page while at the same time populating it with posts.
# 6. Had the javascript from the origin site, function in the new site except for the table hovering.
# 7. Worked with PHP and Wordpress. Pretty Much it.

## NOTE:

# Wordpress themes folder 'ash-domsters-theme'
